Letâ€™s create a new branch based off the v0.1 tag called v0.1-release so you have something to cherry-pick:


1 Change to the directory containing your repository: for example, cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/.
2 Run git checkout -b v0.1-release v0.1.
3 Add some content to the 02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciidoc file.
4 Run git commit --message 'Advanced practice technique.' 02-Advanced-
GitInPractice.asciidoc. The output should resemble the following.
